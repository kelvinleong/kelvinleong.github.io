#### [Oracle SQL] Difference between USER_TABLES, ALL_TABLES and DBA_TABLES
---

User_tables are those owned by specified user(schema).

For example, an oracle database user log in with the identity "USER" and execute the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_tables;
```

Records are tables owned by user "USER".

And if execute the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM all_tables;
```

Now, the retrieved records are tables owned by user USER and those granted to USER but owned by other users.

DBA_tables, contains all the tables in the database.

All three are views of the underlying SYS tables, but the USER_ and ALL_ views joing in your username/security info to limit the results

For constraint/triggers/synonym, it is more or less the same.
