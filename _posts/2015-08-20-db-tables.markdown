####[Oracle SQL] Difference between USER_TABLES, ALL_TABLES and DBA_TABLES
---

User_tables are those owned by the specified user(schema).

For example, an oracle database user log in with the identity "USER" and execute the following sql:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_tables;
```

All the retrieved tables are owned by user "USER" only.

And if execute the following sql:

```sql
SELECT * FROM all_tables;
```

Now, the retrieved tables are owned by user USER and those granted to USER.

DBA_tables, contains all the tables in the database.

So the relation ship should be: DBA_tables > All_Tables > User_Tables.

For constraint/triggers/synonym, it is much the same.
