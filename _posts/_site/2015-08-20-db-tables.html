<h4 id="oracle-sql-difference-between-usertables-alltables-and-dbatables">[Oracle SQL] Difference between USER_TABLES, ALL_TABLES and DBA_TABLES</h4>
<hr />

<p>User_tables are those owned by specified user(schema).</p>

<p>For example, an oracle database user log in with the identity “USER” and execute the following query:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">user_tables</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Records are tables owned by user “USER”.</p>

<p>And if execute the following query:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">all_tables</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now, the retrieved records are tables owned by user USER and those granted to USER but owned by other users.</p>

<p>DBA_tables, contains all the tables in the database.</p>

<p>All three are views of the underlying SYS tables, but the USER_ and ALL_ views joing in your username/security info to limit the results</p>

<p>For constraint/triggers/synonym, it is more or less the same.</p>
